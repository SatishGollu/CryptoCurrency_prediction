This is a university project collaborating with my other 2 collegues maduima Biswas and Ramya vadlamudi. the goal is to predict the crypro currency price in future for the 14 different assests based on the past data

What is Crypto currency???


 Crypto, a form of digital token or “coins” that exist on a distributed and decentralized ledger called a blockchain, is a popular investment nowadays.

A crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.

Over $40 billion worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day. They are among the most popular assets for speculation and investment, yet have proven wildly volatile. Fast-fluctuating prices have made millionaires of a lucky few, and delivered crushing losses to others. Could some of these price movements have been predicted in advance?
